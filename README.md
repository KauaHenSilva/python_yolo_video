# Object Detection with YOLOv4

This project demonstrates object detection using YOLOv4 with OpenCV and Darknet. The project includes two Jupyter notebooks:

1. `main_opencv.ipynb`: Uses OpenCV for object detection.
2. `main_darknet.ipynb`: Uses Darknet for object detection.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Running the Notebooks

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open and run the cells in `main_opencv.ipynb` to perform object detection using OpenCV.
4. Open and run the cells in `main_darknet.ipynb` to perform object detection using Darknet.

### Notes

- The notebooks will download necessary files such as weights, configuration files, and a sample video.
- The `.gitignore` file ensures that large files and outputs are not tracked by Git.
